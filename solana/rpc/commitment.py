"""Commitment options.

Solana nodes choose which bank state to query based on a commitment requirement set by the client.

In descending order of commitment (most finalized to least finalized), clients may specify:
"""
from typing import NewType

Commitment = NewType("Commitment", str)
"""Type for commitment."""

Finalized = Commitment("finalized")
"""The node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum
 lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized."""

Confirmed = Commitment("confirmed")
"""The node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.

- It incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
- It does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.
- This confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.

Processed = Commitment("processed")
